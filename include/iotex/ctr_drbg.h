 * You can override it by calling iotex_ctr_drbg_set_entropy_len().
 *
 * The entropy nonce length is:
 * - \c 0 if the entropy length is at least 3/2 times the entropy length,
 *   which guarantees that the security strength is the maximum permitted
 *   by the key size and entropy length according to NIST SP 800-90A §10.2.1;
 * - Half the entropy length otherwise.
 * You can override it by calling iotex_ctr_drbg_set_nonce_len().
 * With the default entropy length, the entropy nonce length is
 * #IOTEX_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_NONCE_LEN.
 *
 * You can provide a nonce and personalization string in addition to the
 * entropy source, to make this instantiation as unique as possible.
 * See SP 800-90A §8.6.7 for more details about nonces.
