 *
 * \warning         When this function performs a decryption, it outputs the

 *                  authentic. You should use this function to perform encryption

 *                    The plaintext is written to \p output and the
 *                    authentication tag is written to \p tag.
 *                    Note that this mode is not recommended, because it does
 *                    not verify the authenticity of the data. For this reason,
 *                    you should use iotex_gcm_auth_decrypt() instead of
 *                    calling this function in decryption mode.
 * \param length    The length of the input data, which is equal to the length

 * \param add       The buffer holding the additional data. This must be of at
 *                  least that size in Bytes.
 * \param add_len   The length of the additional data.
 * \param input     The buffer holding the input data. If \p length is greater

 * \brief           This function feeds an input buffer into an ongoing GCM
