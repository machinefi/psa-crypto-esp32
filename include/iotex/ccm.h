/**
 * \brief           This function feeds an input buffer into an ongoing CCM
 *                  encryption or decryption operation.
 *
 *                  You may call this function zero, one or more times
 *                  to pass successive parts of the input: the plaintext to
 *                  encrypt, or the ciphertext (not including the tag) to
 *                  decrypt. After the last part of the input, call
 *                  iotex_ccm_finish(). The lengths \p input_len of the
 *                  data parts should eventually add up exactly to the
 *                  plaintext length \c plaintext_len passed to
 *                  iotex_ccm_set_lengths().
 *
 *                  This function may produce output in one of the following
 *                  ways:
 *                  - Immediate output: the output length is always equal
 *                    to the input length.
 *                  - Buffered output: except for the last part of input data,
 *                    the output consists of a whole number of 16-byte blocks.
 *                    If the total input length so far (not including
 *                    associated data) is 16 \* *B* + *A* with *A* < 16 then
 *                    the total output length is 16 \* *B*.
 *                    For the last part of input data, the output length is
 *                    equal to the input length plus the number of bytes (*A*)
 *                    buffered in the previous call to the function (if any).
 *                    The function uses the plaintext length
 *                    \c plaintext_len passed to iotex_ccm_set_lengths()
 *                    to detect the last part of input data.
 *
 *                  In particular:
 *                  - It is always correct to call this function with
 *                    \p output_size >= \p input_len + 15.
 *                  - If \p input_len is a multiple of 16 for all the calls
 *                    to this function during an operation (not necessary for
 *                    the last one) then it is correct to use \p output_size
 *                    =\p input_len.
 *
 * \note            This function is not implemented in Mbed TLS yet.
 *
 * \param ctx           The CCM context. This must have been started with
 *                      iotex_ccm_starts() and the lengths of the message and
 *                      additional data must have been declared with
 *                      iotex_ccm_set_lengths().
 * \param input         The buffer holding the input data. If \p input_len
 *                      is greater than zero, this must be a readable buffer
 *                      of at least \p input_len bytes.
 * \param input_len     The length of the input data in bytes.
 * \param output        The buffer for the output data. If \p output_size
 *                      is greater than zero, this must be a writable buffer of
 *                      at least \p output_size bytes.
 * \param output_size   The size of the output buffer in bytes.
 *                      See the function description regarding the output size.
 * \param output_len    On success, \p *output_len contains the actual
 *                      length of the output written in \p output.
 *                      On failure, the content of \p *output_len is
 *                      unspecified.
 *
 * \return         \c 0 on success.
 * \return         #IOTEX_ERR_CCM_BAD_INPUT on failure:
 *                 \p ctx is in an invalid state,
 *                 total input length too long,
 *                 or \p output_size too small.
