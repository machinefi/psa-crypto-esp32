 *              is later compromised. Call this function on sensitive data

 *              sensitive data stored on the heap before freeing the heap
 *              object.

 *              iotex_platform_zeroize() are not removed by aggressive
 *              compiler optimizations in a portable way. For this reason, Mbed

 * \brief      Platform-specific implementation of gmtime_r()
 *
 *             The function is a thread-safe abstraction that behaves
 *             similarly to the gmtime_r() function from Unix/POSIX.
 *
 *             Mbed TLS will try to identify the underlying platform and
 *             make use of an appropriate underlying implementation (e.g.
 *             gmtime_r() for POSIX and gmtime_s() for Windows). If this is
 *             not possible, then gmtime() will be used. In this case, calls
 *             from the library to gmtime() will be guarded by the mutex
 *             iotex_threading_gmtime_mutex if IOTEX_THREADING_C is
 *             enabled. It is recommended that calls from outside the library
 *             are also guarded by this mutex.
 *
 *             If IOTEX_PLATFORM_GMTIME_R_ALT is defined, then Mbed TLS will
 *             unconditionally use the alternative implementation for
 *             iotex_platform_gmtime_r() supplied by the user at compile time.
 *
 * \param tt     Pointer to an object containing time (in seconds) since the
 *               epoch to be converted
